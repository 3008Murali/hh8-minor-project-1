Ransomware Simulation(Encrypts a test folder to show impact)
Project description 
The current project is an educational simulation of the ransomware attack made using Python programming.
This shows how the ransomware encrypts user files in order to illustrate its effects and generate awareness about cybersecurity threats.
It will only function with the test directory set by the user, holding the dummy files.
It does not affect the system files. There is a decryption script included. The project at hand is strictly for educational purposes.

Tools used
Python 3.x
Cryptography Library (Fernet)
VS Code
Git & GitHub

Running the Project
1. Clone or Download the repository.
2. Install the required library using:
3. Make or position example files in `test_folder`.
4. Run the encryption script: python encrypt.py 
5. Execute a decryption script

What I Learned
Basics of ransomware behavior and file encryption
Implementation of Symmetric Encryption Using Fernet
Importance of protecting encryption keys
Safe execution of security-related projects in a controlled environment
